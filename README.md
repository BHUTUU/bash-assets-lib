# bash-assets-lib
A library in bash for common utilities we use in our bash scripts. This could be so beneficial for you in order to save time and make your code neat and clean!
# Library-Source:
```
source <(curl -fsSL "https://git.io/Jy50f")
```
# Usage:
Just source my library in your script and call your required asset as a function!!! 
* Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
source <(curl -fsSL "https://git.io/Jy50f")
colorCodeNormal    #this function is for importing normal colors!
echo -e "${N2}Hello ${N4}World ${N1} ! ${R0}"
   #N2 is for green, N4 is for blue, N1 is for red and R0 is to kill color(to normalise)!
PROG-BAR2
# this is to call progress bar number 2 which doesn't requires any argument!
```
This is how you can all functions from this library!
